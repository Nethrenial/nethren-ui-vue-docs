# Introduction
Nethren Ui is an open-source UI component library for building high-quality, accessible user interfaces.This documentation explores the official vue 3 edition of the library.

Nethren UI was inspired by few great UI component libraries, primarily Chakra UI  (One of the most prominent ui component libraries in React ecosystem) and Vuesax (a highly attractive set of components only available for vue 2).Goal of Nethren UI is to combine great ideas from different places to in order to build something truly remarkable :-)


## Vision
Most of us share similar definitions for common UI patterns like accordion, checkbox, combobox, dialog, dropdown, select, slider, and tooltip. These UI patterns are documented by WAI-ARIA and generally understood by the community.

However, the implementations provided to us by the web platform are inadequate. They're either non-existent, lacking in functionality, or cannot be customized sufficiently.

So, developers are forced to build custom components; an incredibly difficult task. As a result, most components on the web are inaccessible, non-performant, and lacking important features.

Our goal is to create open-source component library that the community can use to build accessible design systems.

## Key Features

### Accessible
Components adhere to the WAI-ARIA design patterns where possible. We handle many of the difficult implementation details related to accessibility, including aria and role attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation. Learn more in our accessibility overview.

### Styles that fit you
All our components have scoped styles making it easy to use any other css framework or library you like (eg: Tailwind) without affecting the styles of our components.
 
### Customizable
Starting from the color pallete, Nethren UI provides ways to customize how the components will look to your heart's content.All the while making sure everything stays consistent by customizing everything via CSS custom properties that are used in every components

### Developer experience
Built from scratch with typescript, our components have a fully typed and consistent api with great documentation attached right here in the docs :)

### Tree-shaking friendly
We compile all components into one package, so you just have to install once, and have access to all the components. Worry not, it is tree-shaking friendly so any unused components will not be included in the bundle.
